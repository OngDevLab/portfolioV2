title: My Contract Role at Tembo
description: Awesome stuff I did at Tembo!
---

How I got this contract role is a very fun story! Set up a conference call with me if you are interested in hearing it! I joined Tembo for a role because of two aspects: Open Source and Databases. Tembo had both, as an open source Postgres extensions company. I had done many data science contracts in the past, and wanted more experience in data engineering and developer advocacy.

## These were my responsibilities:

- **Outreach and Lead Generation:** I tested multiple lead generating strategies, including outreach with the mayor of Cincinnati, going to conferences, meeting small businesses, connecting with old P&G colleagues, and finally what worked best: Twitter Growth.

- **Write Guides and Documentation:** I have a programming background, so instead of completely focusing on writing copy, I had another aspect where I wrote guides for using the open source Kubernetes Operator and writing connection guides to and from Postgres to various programming languages. You can see my contributions in my Github.

- **Market Analysis:** I did have the opportunity to utilize some data science in my role. I was able to segment the market with clustering and build specific marketing strategies for different target niches.

## Skills Utilized:

- **Web Development:** I had much greater focus in coding while writing the guides. Through the guide writing, I became far more interested in web development and began to understand the inner workings of the web.

- **Cloud-native Kubernetes:** Since I was communicating and writing guides for enterprise clients regarding on-prem use of the Kubernetes operator, I had to take a deep dive on k8s on the big three clouds providers: GCP GKE, Azure AKS, AWS EKS.

- **Developer Marketing:** My core role was marketing and driving signups. During my contract, I had posted the highest signup numbers (the main success metric) and aided in multiple in-flight deals and partnerships with companies such as FerretDB (Postgres Open Source MongoDB alternative).

## Tech Stack:
