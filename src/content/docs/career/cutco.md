title: My Contract Role at Cutco
description: A brief overview of my time at Cutco
---

I wanted to get better at in-person sales. I found a quick short term contract to learn the ropes of sales. Eventually, I ranked as one of the top 15 salespeople in the US. I still use the strategies I learned in the trainings to this day.

## These were my three strategies
- **Sell to who you know:** Selling is much simpler when you have a connection. This strategy landed my initial clients.

- **Give Good Deals==Get Referrals:** I had the cheapest prices compared to my peers. I had negotiated higher volume, which took a small hit to my profits, but I could drive quadruple the customers, as word would spread about my lower prices.

- **Understand the Market:** I sold to mainly the Asian community, as I have a good grasp of the market. In addition, I had a better grasp of our culture and traditions, so I could easily relate and provide multiple use cases with greater impact.

# Skills Utilized:

- **Sales:** I utilized a battle-tested sales manual combined with my understanding of my market to deliver enhanced results.

- **Market Analytics:** Understanding the market and collecting data to test my findings resulted in my strategy.

## Tech Stack
- **Cutco Sales Manual**
- **Every School Directory I Owned**
- **Phonebooks**
- **Excel**
- **Caffeine**
