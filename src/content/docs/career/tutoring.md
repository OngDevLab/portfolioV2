title: My Various Tutoring Roles
description: A few select tutoring roles.

One of my greatest passions is teaching and presenting information in entertaining ways. Throughout my career, I have tutored engineers, developers, saxophonists, artists, and everyone in between!

## I have selected two notable roles:

- **Data Science/Data Engineering Tutoring:** After completing my data engineering certificate from Databricks, I was tapped to lead P&G's corporate engineering division's data science and data engineering upskilling effort. In the end, I had tutored directly over 150 citizen developers, with representation in all business units and business functions. Management had concluded that the effort saved P&G over $30 million directly from my efforts.

- **Electrical Engineering Tutoring:** I tutored over 1,000 students in classes such as Circuits, Advanced Circuits, Electromagnetics, Calculus, Differential Equations, etc. As a result, many students had their exam grades improve!

## Skills Utilized:

- **Teaching:** Tutoring groups and individuals requires a keen understanding of how students learn and retain information. I spent hours figuring out the best research and science-based strategies to keep my students captivated enough to learn effectively. I utilized project-based learning, pomodoro, and interactive visual aids.

- **Technical Communication:** Communicating concisely is key to helping students understand the basics. Most of the time, I was teaching first time programmers and hardware designers, so putting myself in their shoes proved effective.

- **Technical Flexibility:** Many self-help books will teach you to help someone where they are at. Having a flexible and wide technical skillset has saved me multiple times when I had to explain an abstract technical concept to someone completely out of the field of study where I taught my class.

## Tech Stack:
- **Databricks SQL/Python**
- **JupyterLab**
- **ChatGPT**
- **Patience**
- **Power BI**
- **Altera Quartus II**
- **Cyclone FPGA**
