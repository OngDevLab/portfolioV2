title: "Data Science Lead: Engineering at Procter and Gamble"
description: A brief overview of my time at Procter and Gamble
---

I worked at Proctor and Gamble in the engineering divison, but had responsibilities in Brand, R&D, and IT. After my TikTok had started to climb past the sizes of all the other P&G TikTok accounts, the brand divisions took notice. In addition, I had a teaching role which resulted in over 150 citizen developers trained. In total, my efforts delivered over $45 million in value.

## I have selected a few notable projects:

- **Data Science and Data Engineering Tutoring Program:** I created a tutoring program where any division working on any brand could get my programming support. Not only did my students get trained in Databricks and SQL, but since I made the projects interactive and based on their current work, the tutoring became full automation projects. In total, from tutoring, we delivered 100+ automation projects, each with an average savings value of ~$500k.

- **Manufacturing Data Search Engine:** When working in the plants, I had noticed a deep disconnect between the machine operators and the data scientists analyzing the machine. I sought to build a piece of software to bridge the gap. As a result, I built the MVP for and led an 8 person team to deliver a manufacturing data search engine for the entire company. The tool is projected to save P&G around $16 million a year.

- **Audio Classification AI:** After winning the P&G 2023 Deep Learning Hackathon, I had the opportunity to scale the tool to the US and Europe. In addition I had a team of three developers that worked with me to build a hardware device to track shaving usage. The AI reached an F1 score of 97% and held even with new data.

- **TikTok Consulting:** I had developed a TikTok optimization software over a few weekends, and the system started to make us go viral with over 2 million followers. Eventually, P&G top brass took notice and had me consult and aid in TikTok strategy for the entire Swiffer brand. We analyzed thousands of TikTok's and developed a repeatable and captivating strategy for the brand.

## Skills Utilized:
- **Navigating Corporate Environments:** I took some time learning the ropes as an employee, but I finally found a niche I enjoyed. Ironically, after learning what I liked in terms of work, I went back to contracting! However, now, I am equipped with the ability to traverse large organizations from the outside.

- **Python:** 95% of my work was done in Python building data pipelines. I love doing the flashy machine learning model, but the reality is these large companies have so many issues that just need one big pandas function.

- **Managing Expectations:** Often, corporate clients prefer a soft sell with solid data backing. In addition, some of this data would get skewed in the media. It is a fine-line skill to manage an executive's expectations of new technology.

## Tech Stack:

- **Python/Tensorflow**
- **Databricks**
- **F# Safe Stack**
- **Excel**
- **Power BI**
