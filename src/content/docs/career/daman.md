title: Senior Consultant - ML Engineering
description: An overview of my time at Daman Consulting as a government ML engineering contractor for TxDOT.
---
I am currently a Senior Consultant at Daman Consulting, Inc. My focus is ML engineering and AI engineering, with an emphasis on designing secure and scalable production AI architectures and implementations. My main client is the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT).


## I have selected a few key milestones for the current project:

- **Value Projection:** I had the responsibility of calculating and identifying key areas of value for the TxDOT AI POC. From estimates derived from real data samples in our pipeline, I had calculated a value projection of ~$100,000/month in savings in productivity from the AI effort.

- **ML Engineering Pipeline POC:** For a preliminary demo for stakeholders, I had the responsbility of implementing a simplified LLM RAG Pipeline stack hosted on AWS. I leveraged built-in AWS ML features, such as Amazon Bedrock.

- **Secure Network Architecture:** After the demo, I delivered a secure network architecture diagram for the scalable AI product to ensure adherence to all data governance checks.

- **EDA and Hybrid Classical ML/Transformer Analysis:** Once we had gotten the architecture approved, we had access to real data. I combined LLMs and Transformers in conjunction with classical ML models (regression, etc.) to provide insights from our data.

- **LLM RAG Pipeline Development:** After the preliminary analysis, I implemented the RAG pipeline and LLM prompt testing frameworks that will be ready for production workloads. We primarly used Amazon Bedrock for the LLM's and Postgres with pgVector for the vector database.

## Skills Utilized:

- **ML Engineering:** I have had the opportunity to work on all aspects of ML engineering in this role. I have delivered EDA using classical ML techniques, and delivered production pipelines that leverage the latest LLM platforms and technologies.

- **Secure Architecture:** As I came in very early in the project lifecycle, I had more involvement in architecture design decisions. This opportunity allowed me to leverage my passion cybersecurity to deliver a secure and compliant network architecture design with all appropriate routes, SCP's, and business-defined policies accounted for.

- **Data Lakehouse/Database Design and Administration:** In addition to the ML engineering aspects, I also built out classic data engineering pipelines and implemented best-practice database design when implementing the underlying data layer serving the LLM's and auxiliary API's.
