This is where I started learning the basics of marketing and data science. I have always had a fascination about statistics and marketing, and I believe this curiosity started from when our family figured out how to scale the business to multiple six figures.

## Here's three keys to our success:

- **Outreach and Lead Generation:** We developed a referral-based lead generation approach. We used no Zillow or other lead services. We organically generated leads through referrals and a recently-neglected strategy: door-to-door sales. I was responsible for designing the flyers in Adobe Illustrator. We came to this conclusion by A/B testing the market!

- **Low Fees, High Volume:** We charged lower fees than over 95% of all agent teams, yet we were top performers year-after-year. We focused on the low fees, but had compensated with over triple the volume.

- **Customer Service:** This was the cornerstone of our strategy. Good customer service resulted in a consistent and growing stream of referrals that converted higher than alternative lead generating paid tools.

## Skills Utilized:

- **Physical Fitness:** When doing the door-to-door portion of our strategy, we had to walk over 20,000 steps a day. This resulted in conditioning required to keep our muscles functioning.

- **A/B testing:** Marketing relies heavily on A/B tests. This testing allowed us to outperform the market with strategies that many overlooked.

- **Data Science:** When testing for optimal strategies, having the data science background often aided in designing the experiments and executing the assignments.

## Tech Stack:

- **an Ear-to-Ear Smile**
- **Excel**
- **Family**
- **Adobe Illlustrator**
