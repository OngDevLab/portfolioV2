title: Contracting Roles
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

I have done contracting roles since 2010 in various industries, roles, and responsibilities. As my skillset grows, I often take on contracts to gain further experience in new spaces, while offering my clients a unique blend of having a diverse toolkit and high adaptability. Below are the types of roles I have taken, with company names listed based on the type of disclosure agreement:

## Contracting Roles, Responsibilities, and Results:

- **Developer Advocate:** I had a contracting role where I managed growth and signups at a startup. In this role, I developed an effective twitter growth strategy, had the highest daily signups during my time in role, and wrote guides and technical documentation. The technical documentation consisted of connection guides in node.js, python, go, postgres, rails, etc. In addition, I wrote guides on the Kubernetes operator. See [Tembo](./../tembo/) for more details.
- **TikTok Growth Consulting:** I've had various roles with TikTok account growth. This started primarily in 2021, where I began to do TikTok consulting with P&G internally. Eventually, since I was actually in the engineering division at the time, I had to lower my time allotment to TikTok consulting in P&G. I, however, still enjoyed TikTok consulting, so I began to take on clients for brand deals on videos and TikTok strategy.   See [TikTok](./../../projects/tiktok/) for more details.
- **Data Science/ML for Finance:** I had a role where I served as an R&D data scientist overseas in a large Singapore bank. I provided consulting on new data models and machine learning algorithms that could help the business. I also wrote some MVP projects for their teams. This company chose not to disclose their name.

- **RF Design Engineering:** I had a contract to design radiated emmissions mitigation hardware for EU CE compliance for a large US computer manufacturer. My responsibilities included performing the standard tests on the VNA and S parameter analysis, electromagnetic FEM modeling, and the hardware design to mitigate the emissions. This company made me sign a lengthy NDA, so I'm not disclosing their name.

- **Direct Sales and Marketing:** I saw a gap in my skillset at one point in my career: sales. I wanted to gain valuable experience in sales and marketing, so I ended up taking a short term assignment at Vector Marketing, a subsidiary of Alcas Corporation, that manufactures Cutco knives. In my time at the company, I was ranked in the top 15 highest performing salesmen. See [Cutco](./../cutco/) for more details.

- **Real Estate:** I began my career in 2010, helping with the family real estate business. My focus was mainly on the backend, where I handled analytics and tracked the performance of our marketing campaigns. In addition, I also had responsibilities for door-to-door advertising, where I A/B tested multiple flyer types and advertising vectors. In addition, I designed all the signage and digital assets for the business. See [Real Estate](./../realestate/) for more details.

## Skills Utilized:

- **Inbound/Outbound Sales:** My contracting roles came primarily from having a solid roles pipeline. You may be reading this if you are interested in hiring me!

- **Data Science:** During most of my contract roles, I often rely heavily on my data science skillset. It's one of my strongest expertise areas and my clients often cite my combination of data science with a behavioral science tilt as a winning combination.

- **Design(Software, Hardware, 2D):** My roles often extend into integration roles. I work with multi-function teams and startups, so my understanding of software, electronic hardware, engineering, and 2D graphic design result in clear communication between clients and their stakeholders when using my software and MVP products.
