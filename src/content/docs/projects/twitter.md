title: My Project with Twitter Growth and Developer Advocacy
description: My Journey on Twitter
---

The focus of my Twitter growth project was to cultivate a community of tech enthusiasts through memes, developer experience, and fun NFTs! This started when I was in a growth role on contract at a startup. I was primarily hired for my TikTok experience, but quickly learned that most tech movers and shakers focused on Twitter more. Thus, I used the tactics I learned from TikTok to build out and monetize a Twitter account in three months, with 9,000 followers in tech and over 10 million impressions.

## I focused on three key growth vectors:
- **Authority Content:** This has proven to be the most effective content. Authority content, or content that shows my expertise in certain fields helps with organic growth. These posts tend to have the best engagement percentage.

- **Comedy Content/Memes:** Creating comedic relatable developer content garners the highest viewcounts on my tweets. These tweets allow me to reach new audiences and increase my funnel of followers engaging with my content. Also, it's great to help bring a smile to a developer's face!

- **Content that just plain works:** Sometimes, there is a tweet I see in and out of my niche that just plain works well for engagement and comedy. I make note of these tweets and can often recycle them every few months or so. This provides interaction and discussion between my audience.

## Skills Utilized:
- **Software Development:** Since I decided to niche my Twitter to the developer community, I've had many opportunities to showcase my expertise in software development for data scientists.

- **Data Science:** Because of my experience on TikTok, I was able to reuse many of my sentiment analysis models and build new models. Since Twitter gives you an analytics download, I was able to use more statistical methods as well.

- **Behavioral Science:** Creating entertaining content daily requires constant use of improvisation skills and understanding of human behavior. The algorithm wants engagement, so nudging users to engage with my content is an ongoing R&D task.

## Tech Stack:
- **Python/Pandas**
- **Tensorflow/Keras**
- **Twitter**
- **HTML/CSS/JS**
