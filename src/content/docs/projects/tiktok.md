title: My Project with TikTok Growth and Analytics
---

I started a data science experiment in 2019 trying to reapply what I learned about EDA and data science from my work to the areas of Social Media. After leveraging classifiers and sentiment analysis algorithms, my team had figured out how to generate around 3 billion views a year and 2,000,000+ followers on TikTok, repeatable across multiple accounts.

## We focus on three types of accounts:
- **Flagship Production Account:** This is the main account. All our testing and ancillary TikTok accounts feed into this account. We try to not have a focus or niche in this account. The focus is pure growth and impressions. Check out our main account: [@will.ong](https://www.tiktok.com/@will.ong)

- **Niche Production Account:** This account type focuses on a specific niche and is targeted to a specific persona. For example, we have an account devoted only to makeup. This niche style account allows to achieve greater community engagement. Check out a niche account here: [@poissonofficial](https://www.tiktok.com/@poissonofficial)

- **Development Account:** This account type is a pure experimental account. This account can stay idle for months until we decide to run a experiment to test out changes in the algorithm. We have both unmonetized and monetized accounts to test growth rates. This accouht type is essentially our R&D department.

## Skills Utilized:

- **Social Media Management:** Leveraged understanding of TikTok trends and broad social trends to create videos that went viral.

- **Data Science:** Built Tensorflow Models and statistical/econometric models to predict and find content creation strategies that had high success and repeatability.

- **Content Creation:** Learned industry standard software, such as CapCut and Final Cut Pro to create content that had visual appeal.

## Tech Stack:

- **Python**
- **Tensorflow/Keras**
- **TikTok**
