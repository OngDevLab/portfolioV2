description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

This reference serves as a quick summary of my experience. 

Long story short, I have had three distinctly different careers:
- Sales/Design/Social Media Management
- Data Science
- Software Development

I have also worked in multiple different environments:
- Remote 
- Production facilities
- Fortune 500
- Startups
- Overseas
- Contract & Full Time

As a result, I have a relatively wide toolkit I rely on to solve your organization's 
needs. If you are interested in speaking with me in greater detail, please check out my [contacts page](./../contacts/)

## Further reading
